Визуализация данных») и провели небольшое исследование данных. Вы можете использовать результаты своего исследования для построения модели машинного обучения.\n","\n","Напомним контекст задачи:\n","\n","> Некоторый банк обратился к вам за помощью: он хочет разработать кампанию лояльности по удержанию клиентов. Для этого он хочет прогнозировать вероятности оттока клиентов и определять, уйдёт ли клиент в ближайшее время. \n","\n","Итак, ранее вы провели небольшой разведывательный анализ, познакомились с данными и выявили, чем ушедшие клиенты отличаются от лояльных и как между собой связаны различные признаки, определяющие клиентов. Вы отлично справились с первой задачей, и теперь представители банка предлагают вам построить саму модель машинного обучения, которая будет прогнозировать отток клиентов. \n","\n","**Ваша задача** - построить классификатор, который позволит своевременно определять уходящих клиентов банка, оценить качество построенных моделей и проинтерпретировать результаты.\n","\n","Разделим эту задачу на две части:\n","* В первой части мы подготовим данные для моделирования и построим простейшую модель логистической регрессии, оценим её качество и проанализируем результаты её работы.\n","\n","* Во второй части мы займёмся построением моделей дерева решений и случайного леса, сравним их результаты с результатами, полученными на первом этапе, и сделаем финальный вывод.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"fd90490e","metadata":{"id":"fd90490e"},"source":["Для начала импортируем библиотеки, которые нам
